Program-1 
This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It can perform basic arithmetic 
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
 
How it Works 
The program uses a Calculator class to handle the arithmetic operations. When you run the script, it 
prompts you to enter two numbers and the desired operation. An instance of the Calculator class is 
then created with your inputs, and the calculate method is called to perform the operation and display 
the result. 
Features 
• Addition: add 
• Subtraction: subtract 
• Multiplication: multiply 
• Division: divide 
Language Used: 
• Python 
 
 Program-2 
Description: 
Generates and prints the first n odd numbers in sequence. 
How it works: 
• Takes a number n as input. 
• Uses a for loop to calculate and print odd numbers (2*i + 1). 
• Prints them in a single line, separated by commas. 
Language Used: 
• Python 

Progam-3 
Description: 
Generates a sequence of odd numbers using list comprehension. 
How it works: 
• Takes a number n as input. 
• If n is even, reduces it by 1 to ensure odd count. 
• Creates a list of odd numbers using a comprehension. 
• Prints them as a comma-separated string. 
Language Used: 
• Python 
 
 Program-4 
Description: 
Counts how many numbers from a predefined list are divisible by each integer from 1 to 9. 
How it works: 
• A list of numbers is given: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]. 
• For each divisor from 1 to 9, it counts how many numbers are divisible. 
• Stores results in a dictionary and prints it. 
Language Used: 
• Python
